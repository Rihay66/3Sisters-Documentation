Introduction:
A graphics framework-engine library written in C/C++ that currently has 2D graphics capabilities. The engine uses the OpenGL API for rendering graphics and other graphics to load assets, create entity, allow controller inputs, and etc. The engine is composed of the following libraries:

**DUE NOTE: This is a Legacy version of the engine and some or if not most of what is discussed here is relevant information of newer version** 

Libraries:
* GLFW & SDL - For displaying a context window which allows OpenGL to render graphics.
* GLAD - Cross-platform OpenGL API 
* OpenAL - For playing sounds or music files
* SndFile - For loading images

Why:
I've used the Unity Engine since 7th grade. I've used the engine on small projects and then on competitive club projects that have won trophies. I have struggled and grown tired with the software which made it very unpleasant to work with when working on solo projects or getting things done. I've seen a growing number of custom engines made by small developers and observed their workflow. After experimenting in creating this custom framework-engine I've enjoyed and learned a lot from working on it and creating small demos when using it.

The main reason someone else would use this is to use it as a learning example as the engine is sort of representative of how engine's "from scratch" would be constructed. If considered to be used creating an application, due note there will be things you'll have to make yourself as the engine only covers boilerplate stuff such as Window, Renderer, and other.

What to know before starting:
Before starting I highly recommend to learn about OpenGL, plenty of C and C++, and understand the basics of graphics as well on your own make a very small and simple game, and if you don't know where to start I started with https://learnopengl.com/
